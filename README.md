<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<br>
Using everything I have learned over the Fundamentals section of the course, I have built the frontend for an API-powered Bookmarks application that lets the user store and rate their custom web bookmarks.


<h3> User Story: </h3>
<br>
I can add bookmarks to my bookmark list. Bookmarks contain:
    title
    url link
    description
    rating (1-5)

I can see a list of my bookmarks when I first open the app
    All bookmarks in the list default to a "condensed" view showing only title and rating

I can click on a bookmark to display the "detailed" view
    Detailed view expands to additionally display description and a "Visit Site" link

I can remove bookmarks from my bookmark list

I receive appropriate feedback when I cannot submit a bookmark
    Check all validations in the API documentation (e.g. title and url field required)

I can select from a dropdown (a <select> element) a "minimum rating" to filter the list by all bookmarks rated at or above the chosen selection
